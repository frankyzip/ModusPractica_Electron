## 📖 Understanding AGPL-3.0

AGPL-3.0 is more protective than traditional open source licenses:

**Traditional GPL:**

```
Client → Your App → Covered
         (If distributed, must share source)
```

**AGPL-3.0:**

```
Client → Web Browser → Your Server
         (Network use triggers requirement to share source)
```

This means if you provide ModusPractica as a service to users over a network (SaaS), you must make your modified source available to users.

**Example scenarios:**

✅ **AGPL OK:** You modify ModusPractica for internal use
✅ **AGPL OK:** You publish academic research using it
❌ **Need Commercial:** You build a SaaS competing with ModusPractica without releasing your code
❌ **Need Commercial:** You use it in a proprietary desktop app without releasing source

## ⚖️ Legal Notes

Both licenses are legally binding. Choose carefully:

- **AGPL-3.0:** You agree to share improvements and modifications with the community
- **Commercial:** You pay for the right to use without these restrictions
